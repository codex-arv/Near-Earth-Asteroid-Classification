#  Classification and Comparative Analysis of Hazardous Asteroids using Machine Learning

A machine learning project for classifying **Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)** and **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)** using real data from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

I. Built with various regression and classification models including:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Multi Output Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

II. Dataset:
- Source: [Kaggle - NASA JPL Asteroid Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset)
- 9,58,524 rows of real asteroid observations and data

III. Objective:
- Predict whether an object (asteroid) is potentially hazardous or not, based on orbital and physical parameters.

IV. Highlights:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
- Beautiful comparison plots
